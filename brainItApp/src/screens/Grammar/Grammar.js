    My sister started studying Medicine at UBA in Argentina, so I decided to study there too. We hadn’t visited Colombia since January, that is the reason why our grandparents invited us to spend Colombian’s Independence Day with them in Bogotá. When we arrived at the airport, we were running because we were late.
    \n
    At the airport entrancy a dog started to follow us, but it didn’t matter to us. When we arrived to immigration, we knew that this dog was following us. Security guards took us to a cold room. There, they started to check our luggage and we didn't understand why it happened. They said "Our dog sniffed a strong smell" and they asked if we had drugs. We were worried but we didn't have any drugs with us. Finally, they found a bag with some lemons that my sister bought for my grandmother and that was the smell. We could take our flight on time and we promised never to bring lemons up to an airplane again.

    Last Christmas I went to Acacías with my friends to spend holidays there. When we were reaching the bus terminal station, my friend Ana was buying our tickets. We arrived in Acacías that evening. While Mike and I were getting meat for our stay, Ana and Paul were buying some beers and groceries for the party. The next day, we decided to do a BBQ in the garden. While Ana and I were swimming at the pool, Mike and Paul were grilling the meat. We were having such a great time, and out of nowhere Paul’s mother arrived. As Paul was enjoying the BBQ party, he invited her to stay, but Ana, Mike and I were not comfortable with that. So while Paul was convincing his mother to go back home, we were cleaning the mess we made.
    \n
    The next day, when we woke up, all our parents were at our place. It was so embarrassing because they all were getting drunk in the morning, and while Ana and I were getting ready to go Back to Bogotá, Mike and Paul were packing up our bags, the four of us decided not to talk about that day ever again.
